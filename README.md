# My-BitBar-Plugins
The BitBar plugins I use

I created this repo in order to have it ready to be cloned whenever I need to set up a new Mac
Everythin is tested on MacOS 10.14 atm.

Based on BitBar

The bluetooth headphones plugin relies on Blueutil
https://github.com/toy/blueutil

All the plugins are written in bash to minimize the impact on battery life.

The spotify plugin is based on a plugin originally made by Jason Tokoph (jason@tokoph.net) and Marcin Swieczkowski (scatman@bu.edu).
I furtherly improved the project with an artwork, the lyrics support and many more little upgrades.
